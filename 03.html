        <span>The Last Jump Before Sunrise</span>
        <p>The train roared out of the tunnel just as the bridge began to collapse.</p>
        <p>Jax didn’t hesitate. He grabbed the rail, hauled himself onto the roof, and ran as the night wind tore at his coat. Below him, the city burned—riots, blackouts, chaos sparked by the stolen reactor core strapped to his back. If it detonated, everything ended.</p>
        <p>A hover-drone screamed in from the left. Jax dove, rolled, and came up firing. Sparks burst like fireworks as the drone spiraled into the river. He was smiling now—fear sharpened him, made everything clear.

The train lurched. The final gap was coming fast.

Jax ran, jumped, and flew.</p>
<p>For one breathless moment, he was weightless. Then his boots slammed onto solid ground. He hit the release, sent the reactor core skidding into the containment cradle, and slammed the seal shut.

The explosion never came.</p>
<p>Instead, lights flickered back on across the city. Sirens softened into cheers. The sky lightened, bruised purple turning gold as sunrise spilled over the rooftops.

Hours later, Jax sat on the steps of a rebuilt station, sharing greasy food with strangers who felt like friends. Someone laughed. Someone played music.

Jax leaned back, watched the sun climb, and decided this was his favorite ending.

Not perfect.

Just alive—and free.</p>
