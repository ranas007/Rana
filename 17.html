            <h3>murder at 7 pm</h3>
            <p>At exactly 7 p.m., the church bells rang, their echoes rolling through the quiet town of Briar Hollow. On
                Maple Street, the dinner lights flickered on one by one—except at number 14.

                Mrs. Eleanor Grayson lay sprawled across her kitchen floor, a porcelain teacup shattered beside her. The
                grandfather clock ticked loudly in the silence, its hands frozen at seven. The back door swayed
                slightly, creaking in the cold October breeze.</p>
            <p>Earlier that evening, neighbors had seen her arguing with someone on the porch. Voices were raised, sharp
                and hurried. By the time the bells began to ring, the street was empty again.

                Detective Harris arrived at 7:20 p.m., noting the details others might ignore: the untouched roast
                burning in the oven, the single muddy footprint near the sink, and a faint scent of cologne lingering in
                the air. On the counter sat an envelope addressed simply: “At 7.”</p>
            <p>Inside was a photograph of Eleanor standing beside a much younger man, both smiling nervously at the
                camera. Written across it in red ink were two words: “Tell no one.”
                As the bells’ echoes faded, Harris realized something chilling—this murder had not been impulsive. It
                had been scheduled. And someone in Briar Hollow had been watching the clock.</p>
