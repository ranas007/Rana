        <h1>1. Ashoka and the Change of Heart </h1>
        <p>Emperor Ashoka was one of the most powerful rulers of the Maurya dynasty. Early in his reign, he believed
            that strength came from war and conquest. The most important battle he fought was the Battle of Kalinga. It
            was a terrible war. Thousands of soldiers were killed, and many innocent people lost their homes and
            families.</p>
        <p>After the battle, Ashoka walked through the battlefield and saw the suffering he had caused. He saw wounded
            soldiers, crying women, and burning villages. This deeply disturbed him. For the first time, Ashoka felt
            guilt and sorrow instead of pride. He realized that true victory did not come from violence.</p>
        <p>Ashoka decided to change his life. He accepted the teachings of Buddhism and promised never to fight another
            war. Instead of ruling with fear, he ruled with kindness. He built hospitals, planted trees along roads, and
            dug wells for travelers. He sent messages of peace not only across India but also to other countries.</p>
        <p>Ashoka’s transformation made him one of the greatest rulers in Indian history, remembered not for his wars,
            but for his compassion.</p>

        <h1>2. Rani Lakshmibai: The Queen Who Fought</h1>
        <p>Rani Lakshmibai was the brave queen of Jhansi during British rule in India. When her husband died, the
            British East India Company refused to accept her adopted son as the rightful heir. They wanted to take over
            Jhansi using the Doctrine of Lapse.</p>
        <p>Rani Lakshmibai refused to surrender her kingdom. When the Revolt of 1857 began, she became one of its
            strongest leaders. She trained soldiers, formed an army, and even fought on the battlefield herself. Dressed
            as a warrior, she rode her horse with her child tied to her back and led her troops with great courage.</p>
        <p>The British attacked Jhansi with a powerful army. Even though her forces were smaller, Rani Lakshmibai fought
            bravely. She escaped from Jhansi and continued fighting in Gwalior. In the end, she was wounded in battle
            and died fighting for her freedom.</p>
        <p>Her bravery inspired generations of Indians. Rani Lakshmibai is remembered as a symbol of courage, sacrifice,
            and resistance against injustice.</p>

        <h1>3. Mahatma Gandhi and the Salt March</h1>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi believed that freedom could be achieved without violence. One of his most powerful protests
            was
            the Salt March of 1930. At that time, the British had made it illegal for Indians to make their own salt.
            Everyone had to buy salt from the British government and pay tax on it.</p>
        <p>Gandhi decided to break this unjust law peacefully. He began a long walk from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, a
            coastal village, covering about 240 kilometers. Many people joined him along the way. Villagers left their
            homes
            to walk beside him, turning the march into a national movement.</p>
        <p>After reaching Dandi, Gandhi picked up a handful of salt from the sea, openly breaking the law. This simple
            act
            had a powerful impact. Across India, people began making salt and protesting British rule peacefully.</p>
        <p>The Salt March showed the strength of non-violence and unity. It made the world notice India’s struggle for
            freedom and proved that even simple actions, when done together, can challenge a powerful empire.</p>
